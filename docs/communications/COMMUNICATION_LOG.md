## 2025-11-20 – Motoko Frozen Screen Incident & System Health Watchdog {#2025-11-20-frozen-screen}

### Context
Motoko's main screen was reported as frozen/unresponsive when accessed via VNC. This required immediate diagnosis and permanent resolution following IaC/CaC principles.

### Actions Taken
**Codex-DCA-001 (Chief Device Architect):**

#### Immediate Diagnosis
- ✅ **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - 10 MCP containers in crash loops (constant restart churn)
  - Tailscale runaway at 361% CPU (6+ hours accumulated)
  - GNOME Shell error storm (420K+ stack traces per hour)
  - System resource exhaustion (load average 8.42 on 4-core system)
  - systemd-journal at 100% CPU (flooded by errors)

#### Immediate Resolution
- ✅ **Container Management:** Stopped all crash-looping MCP containers and disabled restart policies
- ✅ **Tailscale Recovery:** Restarted tailscaled service (CPU normalized)
- ✅ **Display Recovery:** Restarted GDM service (GNOME Shell recovered)
- ✅ **VNC Recovery:** Restarted TigerVNC to connect to fresh session
- ✅ **Docker Configuration:** Implemented logging limits (10MB max-size, 3 files)

#### Permanent Solution (IaC/CaC)
- ✅ **System Health Watchdog:**
  - Created `ansible/roles/monitoring/` with watchdog implementation
  - Deployed `/usr/local/bin/system-health-watchdog.sh` (runs every 5 minutes)
  - Monitors: Load average, critical services, crash loops, runaway processes, GNOME health
  - Auto-recovery: Restarts services, stops crash loops, resource limit enforcement
  
- ✅ **Automated Recovery Playbook:**
  - Created `ansible/playbooks/motoko/recover-frozen-display.yml`
  - Idempotent emergency recovery via Ansible
  
- ✅ **Monitoring Deployment Playbook:**
  - Created `ansible/playbooks/motoko/deploy-monitoring.yml`
  - Deploys watchdog service and configuration

- ✅ **Documentation:**
  - Created `docs/runbooks/MOTOKO_FROZEN_SCREEN_RECOVERY.md` (incident response)
  - Created `docs/runbooks/SYSTEM_HEALTH_WATCHDOG.md` (watchdog operations)

### Outcomes
- **Immediate:** System recovered, load dropped from 8.42 to 3.58, screen responsive
- **Prevention:** Automated watchdog prevents recurrence (5-minute check interval)
- **Recovery:** Emergency playbook for manual intervention if needed
- **Compliance:** Full IaC/CaC implementation (all configs managed as code)
- **Documentation:** Complete runbooks for operations and troubleshooting

### System Health Status
**Before:**
- Load: 8.42
- CPU: 48% idle
- Tailscale: 361% CPU
- GNOME: 420K errors/hour
- Containers: 10 crash-looping

**After:**
- Load: 3.58
- CPU: 98% idle
- Tailscale: Normal
- GNOME: Stable (2 log entries/minute)
- Containers: Stopped and monitored

### Next Steps
- Monitor watchdog performance over 48 hours
- Investigate root cause of MCP container failures
- Consider Prometheus/Grafana for real-time monitoring
- Implement alerting for critical conditions

## 2025-01-XX – Data Lifecycle Implementation (motoko) {#2025-01-lifecycle-impl}

### Context
The cloud backplane (B2 buckets, Azure Key Vault secrets) has been provisioned by the `miket-infra` team. The final step is to deploy the automation logic on `motoko` to orchestrate the data flow.

### Actions Taken
**Codex-DEVOPS-004 (DevOps Engineer):**
- ✅ **Role Creation:** Implemented `ansible/roles/data-lifecycle`.
- ✅ **Secret Management:**
    - Implemented `tasks/credentials.yml` to securely fetch B2 keys from Azure Key Vault.
    - Populated `/etc/miket/storage-credentials.env` (root:root 0600) with B2 application keys.
- ✅ **Script Deployment:**
    - Deployed `flux-graduate.sh` (Data movement).
    - Deployed `space-mirror.sh` (Rclone sync).
    - Deployed `flux-backup.sh` (Restic cloud backup).
    - Deployed `flux-local-snap.sh` (Restic local snapshot).
- ✅ **Automation:**
    - Deployed and enabled Systemd Timers for all tasks (Hourly/Nightly).
- ✅ **Validation:**
    - Verified `flux-local.service` successfully creates snapshots in `/space/snapshots/flux-local`.
    - Verified `flux-backup.service` successfully initializes and backs up to `b2:miket-backups-restic:flux`.

### Outcomes
- **Data Protection:** Active working set (`/flux`) is now backed up locally every hour and to the cloud every day.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Cloud buckets are initialized and receiving data.
- **Automation:** Zero-touch operation managed by systemd.

### Next Steps
- Monitor B2 billing and ingress/egress.
- Verify graduation logic after 30 days of data aging.

## 2025-01-XX – Data Lifecycle Automation Enhancement (motoko) {#2025-01-lifecycle-enhancement}

### Context
Following the initial deployment, manual fixes were required for password file generation and directory structure. These have been automated in the Ansible role to ensure idempotency and zero-touch operation.

### Actions Taken
**Codex-DEVOPS-004 (DevOps Engineer):**
- ✅ **Directory Structure Enforcement:**
    - Added tasks to create all required directories per `DATA_LIFECYCLE_SPEC.md`:
    - `/flux/active/`, `/flux/scratch/`, `/flux/models/`, `/flux/.policy/`
    - `/space/projects/`, `/space/media/`, `/space/datasets/`, `/space/archives/`
    - `/space/snapshots/flux-local/` (ensured before scripts run)
- ✅ **Password File Automation:**
    - Added task to generate `/root/.restic-local-pass` if missing (using `openssl rand -base64 32`)
    - Uses `stat` module to check existence before generation
- ✅ **Exclude File Automation:**
    - Added task to create `/flux/.backup-exclude` if missing (empty file, can be populated later)
- ✅ **Documentation:**
    - Created `docs/product/CHIEF_ARCHITECT_SUMMARY.md` with comprehensive implementation summary
    - Updated `EXECUTION_TRACKER.md` with new deliverables

### Outcomes
- **Idempotency:** Playbook can be re-run safely without manual intervention
- **Zero-Touch:** All required files and directories created automatically
- **Documentation:** Complete handoff document for Chief Architect review

### Validation
- ✅ Playbook runs successfully in check mode
- ✅ All directories created with correct ownership (mdt:mdt)
- ✅ Password file generation skipped when file exists
- ✅ Exclude file created automatically
