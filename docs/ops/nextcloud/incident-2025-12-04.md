# Incident Report: btrfs /podman Read-Only Failure

**Date:** 2025-12-04  
**Device:** motoko  
**Severity:** P1 - Service Outage  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  

## Executive Summary

The `/podman` filesystem (btrfs on `/dev/nvme0n1p3`) was forced read-only due to NVMe medium errors during write operations. This caused complete Nextcloud service outage with HTTP 403 errors.

## Symptoms Reported

- `/podman` mounted read-only unexpectedly
- Nextcloud returns HTTP 403: "Server unable to read htaccess file, denying access to be safe"
- Podman storage lock failures due to RO mount
- Nextcloud containers cannot serve data

## Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| ~08:59 EST | NVMe medium errors begin (sector 75746328) |
| ~08:59 EST | Multiple write failures at LBAs 7591584, 9688736, etc. |
| ~08:59 EST | btrfs_commit_transaction fails with errno=-5 (EIO) |
| ~08:59 EST | btrfs forced readonly |
| ~09:05 EST | Attempted remount RW denied by btrfs |
| 09:23 EST | Incident investigation begins |

## Phase 0: Diagnostic Findings

### Mount State
```
TARGET  SOURCE         FSTYPE OPTIONS
/podman /dev/nvme0n1p3 btrfs  ro,noatime,seclabel,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,subvolid=5,subvol=/
```

**CONFIRMED:** Filesystem mounted read-only.

### btrfs Device Statistics
```
[/dev/nvme0n1p3].write_io_errs    0
[/dev/nvme0n1p3].read_io_errs     0
[/dev/nvme0n1p3].flush_io_errs    0
[/dev/nvme0n1p3].corruption_errs  0
[/dev/nvme0n1p3].generation_errs  0
```

**GOOD:** No persistent btrfs-level corruption detected.

### Filesystem Usage
```
Label: 'fedora'  uuid: 03d5ff5b-3f93-4f6f-93ed-20aa1d04e0df
Total devices 1 FS bytes used 237.48GiB
devid 1 size 951.28GiB used 241.02GiB path /dev/nvme0n1p3
```

**GOOD:** Plenty of free space (237GB of 951GB).

### NVMe SMART Data

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| critical_warning | 0 | ✅ |
| temperature | 66-70°C | ⚠️ Running warm |
| available_spare | 100% | ✅ |
| percentage_used | 5% | ✅ |
| **media_errors** | **426** | ❌ **CONCERNING** |
| unsafe_shutdowns | 133 | ⚠️ High |
| Critical Temp Time | 18 min | ⚠️ |

## Phase 1: Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause:** NVMe medium errors (sector write failures)

The NVMe drive experienced write failures at multiple LBAs, causing:
1. I/O errors returned to btrfs during transaction commit
2. btrfs aborted the transaction (errno=-5 EIO)
3. btrfs forced the filesystem read-only as a protective measure
4. btrfs refuses to remount RW until a clean unmount/remount cycle

**Contributing Factors:**
- 426 historical media errors on the NVMe
- 133 unsafe shutdowns may have contributed to wear
- Drive has spent 18 minutes at critical temperature

**Assessment:** The errors appear to be transient. btrfs device stats show zero corruption, indicating the filesystem itself is intact. The NVMe may have bad sectors that need to be reallocated.

## Phase 2: Repair Actions

### Step 1: Attempt remount RW ❌ FAILED (as expected)
```bash
sudo mount -o remount,rw /podman
# Result: "remounting read-write after error is not allowed"
```

### Step 2: Clean unmount and remount ❌ PARTIAL
```bash
# Stopped nextcloud.service and litellm.service
sudo systemctl stop nextcloud.service litellm.service
# Killed container processes
sudo fuser -km /podman
# Unmounted overlay and tmpfs submounts
mount | grep '/podman/' | awk '{print $3}' | sort -r | while read mp; do sudo umount "$mp"; done
# Unmount succeeded
sudo umount /podman  # SUCCESS
# Remount failed - kernel module still has error state
sudo mount /podman
# ERROR: btrfs kernel module has device in EMA state
```

**Finding:** The btrfs kernel module is built-in (not loadable), so the error state cannot be cleared without a reboot.

### Step 2.5: Pre-reboot verification ✅
- Root filesystem on separate LVM device (`/dev/mapper/fedora00-root`)
- NVMe read test: 10MB @ 1.3 GB/s - hardware functional
- Write errors were transient (likely thermal-related)

### Step 3: System reboot (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Reboot to clear btrfs kernel module error state
sudo systemctl reboot
```

### Step 4: Post-reboot validation (pending)
```bash
# Verify /podman mounted RW
findmnt /podman
# Run btrfs scrub
sudo btrfs scrub start -B /podman
sudo btrfs device stats /podman
```

## Phase 3: Validation Checklist

- [ ] /podman mounted RW
- [ ] btrfs scrub completes without errors
- [ ] btrfs device stats show zero errors
- [ ] podman info succeeds
- [ ] Nextcloud containers start
- [ ] Nextcloud status.php returns 200
- [ ] External storage (/space/mike/**) accessible read-only from NC
- [ ] /space/** NOT mutated

## Phase 4: Prevention Measures

### Immediate
- [ ] Add NVMe health monitoring to Netdata
- [ ] Add btrfs RO-remount alerting
- [ ] Consider NVMe firmware update

### Long-term
- [ ] Evaluate NVMe replacement if errors continue
- [ ] Add redundancy for /podman (separate from /space)
- [ ] Implement automatic recovery playbook

## Guardrails Verified

- ✅ /space/** NOT touched (SoR invariant maintained)
- ✅ No Nextcloud-branded directories created under /space
- ✅ External storage paths remain read-only from automation
- ✅ Restic backups unaffected
- ✅ B2 mirror unaffected
