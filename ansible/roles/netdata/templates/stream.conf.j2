# =============================================================================
# STREAMING IS DISABLED
# =============================================================================
#
# This deployment uses Netdata Cloud (Homelab) as the unified monitoring UI.
# Parent/child streaming is NOT used - Cloud handles aggregation.
#
# Each node runs a standalone agent claimed to Cloud via ACLK.
# There is no local parent aggregator.
#
# If you need to enable streaming in the future (e.g., for air-gapped
# environments), uncomment and configure the sections below.
#
# =============================================================================

[stream]
    # Streaming is DISABLED - Cloud is our aggregator
    enabled = no

# =============================================================================
# LEGACY REFERENCE (NOT ACTIVE)
# =============================================================================
# The parent/child topology was removed in favor of Cloud-centric monitoring.
# These settings are kept as documentation only.
#
# To stream to a parent (if ever needed):
#   [stream]
#       enabled = yes
#       destination = parent.example.com:19999
#       api key = <uuid>
#
# To accept streams as a parent (if ever needed):
#   [<api-key-uuid>]
#       enabled = yes
#       allow from = 100.*
#       default memory mode = dbengine
