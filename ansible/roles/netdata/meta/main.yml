    Self-hosted Netdata monitoring with parent/child streaming topology.
    Parent node (motoko) provides centralized dashboards and long-term retention.
    Child nodes stream metrics to parent while maintaining minimal local buffer.
    All traffic stays within the Tailscale tailnet - no Netdata Cloud dependency.
